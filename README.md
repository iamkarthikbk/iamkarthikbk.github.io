- Additional assets (images, PDFs, etc.) can be added to appropriate directories as needed

## Local Development

This website is designed to be hosted on GitHub Pages. To deploy:

1. Create a repository named `yourusername.github.io`
2. Push this code to the repository
3. Enable GitHub Pages in the repository settings
4. Your site will be available at `https://yourusername.github.io`

## Customization

Feel free to modify the content and styling in `index.html` to match your preferences. The current design uses a pastel color scheme suitable for academic/research profiles.
